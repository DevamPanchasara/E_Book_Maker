One of the best ideas to start experimenting with hands-on computer science projects for students is working on an online eBook maker. This online eBook maker will allow users to design and create eBooks free of cost. The system has two modules â€“ admin login and author login. The admin can accept requests from users (authors), check and validate their details, evaluate completed eBooks, and process the request by mailing eBooks to the authors. Users can register in the system using the author login. After filling in the necessary details, users can create new books, specify the context of books, add the title, number of pages, add a book cover, etc. Existing users can simply log in using their ID and password, and they can either create new books or resume editing the existing (unfinished) eBooks. Authors can keep only three incomplete eBooks at a time, of which they must complete at least one book before starting a new book.
